## Description
This project aim to contain most of Deduction and Calculation in Robotics, both **Numeric** and **Symbolic**.

The Basic symbolic math tool realized include **Scalar, Vector, Matrix** and generally **Tensor**

The math functor realized include **partial differential** ,**Jacobian**, **tensor transform** and some related topic constructed by these 

The application obviously contains **coordinate transform, Direct/ Inverse Kinematic, Dynamics** and **Trajectory Planning**

Using such math tool, it also can easly represently the most advanced topic like **Lie Algebra** and **non-linear control**

It is not aim to some specific examples or particular robot configuration, it is more generally tool for realize ever related topic coverd in Robotics, But the follow documents will shows some examples Based on **Topic**, **Function** and **Calculation** in Robotics, organised by Guide which includes some specific topic and Advanced Topic which inclueds more math but more useful in Research and practice.


## Guide
