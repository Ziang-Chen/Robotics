## Description
This project aim to contain most of Deduction and Calculation in Robotics, both **Numeric** and **Symbolic**.

The Basic symbolic math tool realized include **Scalar, Vector, Matrix** and generally **Tensor**

The math functor realized include **partial differential** ,**Jacobian**, **tensor transform** and some related topic constructed by these 

The application obviously contains **coordinate transform, Direct/ Inverse Kinematic, Dynamics** and **Trajectory Planning**

Using such math tool, it also can easly represently the most advanced topic like **Lie Algebra** and **non-linear control**
